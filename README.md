Usage:

- create a file called token.txt in the same directory as index.js and paste your GitHub Personal Access Token into it
  - if you don't have a GitHub Personal Access Token, you can create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- there are constants that can be used to configure the script at the top of index.js
- run the script with `npm start`
